## SI 618: Data Manipulation and Analysis – Final Project
This repository contains the final project for **SI 618: Data Manipulation and Analysis** at the University of Michigan.  
Our project focuses on analyzing the **U.S. Tesla vehicle sales dataset** by cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to better understand sales patterns, pricing dynamics, and product characteristics.  

By combining raw sales data with **VIN-decoded vehicle information**, we explored how different factors—such as model type, body type, motor/drive unit, and geography—affect sales performance and pricing. The project applies the full workflow of data wrangling, exploratory analysis, statistical inference, and predictive modeling.  

## Project Overview  
The project is divided into three main parts:  

### Part I – Data Acquisition & Cleaning  
- Collected Tesla sales data and enriched it with VIN-decoded features.  
- Cleaned raw datasets by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- Standardized variables for use in further analysis.  

### Part II – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Conducted descriptive statistics and data visualizations to uncover key patterns.  
- Analyzed distributions of sale prices across different models and trims.  
- Explored geographical sales distribution and motor/drive unit popularity.  
- Identified correlations between vehicle characteristics and pricing.  

### Part III – Modeling & Evaluation  
- Built statistical models (including ANOVA and regression) to quantify factor impacts on price.  
- Evaluated model performance and discussed the implications of results.  
- Interpreted findings to highlight the major drivers of Tesla sales and pricing differences.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and documentation
